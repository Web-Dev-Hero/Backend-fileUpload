# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




Introduction
React Router is a powerful library that enables routing and navigation in React applications. It allows developers to define different routes and render different components based on the current URL.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-routes.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd react-routes
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.
Usage
The project demonstrates basic usage of React Router for creating routes and navigating between different components.

The main application component is wrapped in a <BrowserRouter> component to enable routing.
Routes are defined using the <Route> component from react-router-dom, specifying the path and component to render for each route.
Navigation links are created using the <Link> component, allowing users to navigate to different routes.
